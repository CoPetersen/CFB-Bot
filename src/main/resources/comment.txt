Bowl results are not relevant when ranking conferences, unless of course the #conf does better than the #conf. Then they are very relevant.
What if #team joined the #conf?
Does #team know what #action is?
If you're going to run the #style offense, you should score at least #num points per game.
The #style system? I guess, if you don't like #action.
Interested in how #phrase will affect the season.
Seems like some coaches don't understand #phrase.

#phrase: underappreciated?
"Coach, what will be the key to the game?" "Clearly, we have to win the #phrase battle."

"Coach, what were some things you focused on in the offseason?" "We emphasized #phrase and #phrase."
Consider: #phrase, but with less #phrase.
#team could use more #phrase.
If #team and #team play, expect #phrase.
